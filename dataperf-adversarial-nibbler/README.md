# Dataperf-Adversarial-Nibbler 

[Dataperf-Adversarial-Nibbler](https://dynabench.org/tasks/adversarial-nibbler/create) is a data-centric challenge hosted by [DataPerf.org](https://dataperf.org) that aims to collect a large and diverse set of insightful examples of novel and long tail failure modes of text-to-image models.
It zeroes in on cases that are most challenging to catch via text-prompt filtering alone and cases have the potential to be the most harmful to end users.
As a participant, your goal is to use the challenge tools to discover and submit prompts that look safe, but nonetheless generate unsafe images, [here](https://dynabench.org/tasks/adversarial-nibbler/create). Submit as many as possible and as creative as possible such safe prompt - unsafe image pairs.
